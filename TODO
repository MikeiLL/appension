REQUIREMENTS
        Change image on mute button
        Add Navigation and Informational Pages (everything on current site)
        Simple Design and Design Implementation
        Ensure we have all of the Correct Tracks and Versions without Duplicates
        Deploy to World Wide Web (including server configuration)
        Test (load testing, various platforms, browsers)
        Fix issues
        Point Domain Name to it and “publish”

RECOMMENDATIONS
        Auto-email admin(s) when tracks are submitted
        Fine-tune player (tracks that fade out get cross-faded, etc)

STRONG DESIRES
        Add the story and/or artist info for each segment to show when user clicks on it as it goes by in player
-- Shouldn't be too hard, is a good reason to use pointers rather than all data in ID3
-- Curating the data is the time-consuming part
-- Might be worth storing some of this in git, rather than the database - GitHub + PRs rather than writing your own edit screens
../stories/%d.txt
        A less simple Design and Design Implementation
        Offer users a UJam.com template to play with in creating their own segment
        Add lyrics from each segment to database (won't be aligned to beats, just a block of text as per story)
        Status/heartbeat URL endpoint
        Monitor: ping heartbeat, email if unsuccessful (for any definition of "unsuccessful")

REALLY COOL
        Allow Users to Browse or Search tracks based on tags (style, attitude, instrumentation) and insert into the queue
-- That's a lot more work, leave that for later
-- have to be concerned with spammers and trolls
        Stats on how often a particular track has been inserted - a simple popularity contest
        List of "Hidden gems" - tracks with low popularity

Database Fields

Get to know PostgreSQL (name derives from Ingres)
    Workflow is important:
      Start a transaction
      Do the work
      Rollback or Commit
    psycopg2
    psql command-line client

Choose a front end player that expects an mp3 stream
    looks like there's one bundled with foreverFM.

Solve 'No handlers could be found for logger (__main__)' messages in _forever.
Solve 'socket.error: [Errno 61] Connection refused' error in test_listener.py

Experimented with numpy.ndarray.dump, numpy.savetxt and data for a 6mb mp3 is about 20mb numpy array in a text file.

_forever/server.py and _forever/monitor.py create Tornado classes
