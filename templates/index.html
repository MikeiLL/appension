    <p>Chris Butler's "The Devil Glitch" was released in 1996, and the next year was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest pop song ever, practically filling an entire CD.
Well, now he's making it even longer, with your help. Add your contribution here, join in the Forums, or just listen and learn about the project.</p>

    <h3>What's it all about?</h3>
                <p>Ten years ago, I recorded a project called "The Devil Glitch," which got certified by The Guinness Book of Records as the World’s Longest Pop Song.*</p>

				<p>The tune was constructed by passing out a 2-3 minute chunk with a 114 Beats-Per-Minute click track/an acoustic guitar track (the chords are A Bm D6) and a portion of the 500+ choruses. I then asked folks to add a backing track – synths, spoons, tuned vacuum cleaners…whatever – then stitched the whole thing together on a computer (kudos to engineer Scott Anthony for this).</p>

				<p>Also, ten years ago, the most recording time on a commercially pressed CD was 74 minutes. Today, thanks to the internet – there is NO time limit, so I’m in the process of expanding the song, making an online version that hopefully will go on for hours and hours…and would love it if you could record something and get it back to me in an MP3 format. </p>

				<p>Feel free to explore the rest of this site – there are composition tools, spare lyrics for you to use (and contribute to), the original versions of the song, the latest submissions and of course – the entire, current Infinite Glitch.</p>

				<p>Note: - the part that I’d like for you to expand upon is the ending vamp where every lyric line begins “Sometimes you can fix something by…”.</p>

				<p>Other than that – anything goes!</p>

				<p>If you’re up for this and/or need more info, please contact me here.</p>

				<p>PLEASE PASS THIS URL ON TO ANYONE YOU THINK MIGHT LIKE TO PARTICIPATE. </p>

				<p>(Musical ability not necessary...in fact, it's probably a hindrance!)</p>

				<p>Have fun, and I’m looking forward to hearing what you come up with!</p>

				<p>Best…</p>

				<p>Chris Butler – 8/07</p>

				<p>*(Writing a 69-minute pop song is one thing...proving that it's the longest is quite another. Guinness asked for independent verification, and although I knew it to be a valid claim, getting others to confirm it became a "computer era" question, where information becomes available only if the question is phrased correctly. For example, neither the Library of Congress (where American copyrights are registered), BMI and ASCAP (the USA's major performance rights organizations) nor The Harry Fox Agency (collector of mechanical rights) can search their databases for length...only by title and author. Luckily, David Sanjek of the BMI Archives was able to confirm my claim stating that "I know of no other commercial piece of music that received sufficient public distribution that comes close to "The Devil Glitch" in length and scope." William Shurck, the Sound Recordings Archivist at Bowling Green State University's Music Library and Sound Archive, also saw no reason to dispute my claim, based on his "...40-plus years of working with popular music.")</p>

    <br><b><b>The Devil Glitch</b></b><br>
world's longest pop song - 69 minutes<br>
July 11th, 1997,<br>
Guinness Book of World Records<br>
declares "The Devil Glitch" to be<br>
THE WORLD'S LONGEST POP SONG.<br>
<p>"Then there's ex-Waitress CHRIS BUTLER'S 69-minute (!) single, "The 
Devil Glitch" (Future Fossil, CD), a screwy swinger with an hour's worth
 of Butler lyrically vamping on the end chorus as friends, old band 
mates, and relatives (including Freedy Johnston, Kramer, and Butler's 
mom) mess with the music. Weird, long-winded, wonderful."</p>

      "THE DEVIL GLITCH"</b><BR><FONT size=-1>- from the liner notes</B></FONT> 
      <P>"ummmm...yeah, so i'm trading off playing demos with Nicky from Dots Will Echo, and he plays one and i play one and he plays one and then i play him The Devil Glitch, apologizing sheepishly 'cause the vamp at the end is 12 choruses long and i don't remember if he said it or if i said it or if the caffeine said it but suddenly we're both giggling 'cause the problem with the song isn't that it's too long it's that it's too short! and wow! wouldn't it be cool to fill up a whole CD with choruses?? 
<P>"so that's what i did. three months later i'd written over 550 of them (usually in the early, early AM before the cares of the day shut off the joy valve), then passed out 2-3 minute chunks on ADAT cassettes (wake up, Alesis...promotional opportunity!) to people i've worked with and asked them to add accompaniment. this was in April of '95 thinking i'd have the chunks back in a month and the whole thing assembled by Memorial Day, wrong. it took a year to get everything organized, but that's okay 'cause the software to actually glue the thing together wasn't available in '95 and Freedy Johnston took forever to hand in his piece (worth it) and Kramer (the Waitresses' orginal sound man!) had to be goosed to get his bit in (also worth it) and John Giant Flansburgh will finish his one day (non-LP B-side!) and don't get me started about my Mom (never try to produce your Mom). 
<P>"anyway...it's done and it's 69-minutes long and there's also the 5-minute/radio-friendly (or unfriendly 'cause of all the cuss words) original version."

      <CENTER><b><b>The Story Behind the One-Minute Version of "The Devil Glitch"</b></b><BR></CENTER><P>Morgan Fisher (ex-Mott The Hoople keyboardist) requested a one-minute version of "The Devil Glitch" for inclusion in his second <EM>"Miniatures"</EM> CD. The 60 or so compositions on this disc come from around the world and all deal in some way with a Millenium theme. <br><br>Morgan never said WHICH Millenium, however. "The Devil Glitch" includes an audio time-travel ending, which is a regression back to 1900 via the entire history of audio recording technology (digital-tape-wire-wax cylinder).
