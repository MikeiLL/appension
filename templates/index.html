      <p>Chris Butler's "The Devil Glitch" was released as a CD in 1996, and the next year was
      certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Longest Recorded Pop Song. But
      there was a. . .well, glitch. . .the song should have been longer, but due to the 74-minute
      recording time limit of the CD format, parts had to be edited out.<br />
      <br />
      Then along came the world wide web, with no time limit for audio, and the 69-minute original
      version became 199x's "The Major Glitch", clocking in at 3 hours 13 minutes and 32 seconds,
      thanks to contributions from around the world. But it's STILL not long enough, which brings
      us to the new, improved "The Infinite Glitch".<br />
      <br />
      Enjoy the project in its original CD length, listen chunk by chunk, stream it as an infinite
      loop, or access the song's wisdom from The Glitch Oracle. But most importantly, PLEASE check
      out the Submissions page <a href="/submit">HERE</a> for tools and guidelines so YOU can
      become a part of "The Infinite Glitch" project.<br />

      <p>In 1995, I wrote and recorded a song called "The Devil Glitch", which clocked in at 5:03.
      One day, I'm trading off playing demos with muso pal Nick Berry from Dots Will Echo, and he
      plays one and I play one and he plays one and then I play him "The Devil Glitch", apologizing
      sheepishly 'cause the vamp at the end is 12 choruses long and I don't remember if he said it
      or if I said it or if the caffeine said it but suddenly we're both giggling 'cause the
      problem with the song isn't that it's too long it's that it's too <b><i>short</i></b>! and
      wow!...wouldn't it be cool to fill up a whole CD with choruses??<br />
      <br />
      So that's what I did. Three months later I'd written over 550 of them (usually in the early,
      early morning before the cares of the day shut off the joy valve). I then recorded the whole
      thing at one sitting with an acoustic guitar (the chords are A Bm D6) to an 114 BPM click
      track in 20-minute chunks at Harold Dessau Studios in Lower Manhattan, with Scott Anthony
      engineering (and soon to be drafted as the project's long-time, long-suffering Sys Op). The
      next step was to pass out 2-3 minute chunks on Alesis ADAT cassettes to people I've worked
      with and asked them to add their own background accompaniment on synths, spoons, tuned vacuum
      cleaners...whatever. This was in April of '95, thinking I'd have everything back by May and
      the whole thing assembled by Memorial Day. Wrong. It took a year to get everything organized,
      but that's okay 'cause the software to actually glue the thing together wasn't available in
      '95, and Freedy Johnston took forever to hand in his piece (worth it) and Liam Sternberg (Mr.
      "Walk Like An Egyptian") from Akron and now France had to do his too and Kramer (who had been
      the Waitresses original sound man!) had to be goosed to get his bit in (also worth it) and
      don't get me started about my Mom (never try to produce your Mom).<br />
      <br />
      Scott stitched the whole thing together using SAW+ (we had become a Beta project for the
      software!), having to regrettably edit the long version down to allow for the original 5:03
      song, since at the time CDs could only hold 74 minutes of audio.<br />
      <br />
      For a laugh, i sent a copy of the CD to the Guinness Book people, think i might have
      inadvertently set a record. Their response was "Maybe. Yep. Prove it." Guinness required for
      independent verification, and although I knew it to be a valid claim, getting others to
      confirm it became a "computer era" question, where information becomes available only if the
      question is phrased correctly.<br />
      <br />
      For example, neither the Library of Congress (where American copyrights are registered), BMI
      and ASCAP (the USA's major performance rights organizations) nor The Harry Fox Agency
      (collector of mechanical rights) can search their databases for length...only by title and
      author. Luckily, David Sanjek of the BMI Archives was able to confirm my claim stating that
      "I know of no other commercial piece of music that received sufficient public distribution
      that comes close to "The Devil Glitch" in length and scope." William Shurck, the Sound
      Recordings Archivist at Bowling Green State University's Music Library and Sound Archive,
      also saw no reason to dispute my claim, based on his "...40-plus years of working with
      popular music."). Homer's "Illiad" and "Odessey" were actually "sung". . .but no one is
      around who remembers how it goes. "Alice's Restaurant"? A mere 19-minutes, and it's as much
      talking as it is a "song", which is legally defined in America as a "lyric with a melody".
      I'm sure my record has long been broken, and as far as i know, Guinness has retired the
      category, but the original project was fun to do, and it's nice to be recognized...even for
      such a dubious achievement.<br />
      <br />
      And now we have "The Infinite Glitch which is were you, Dear Reader, come in. Please got to
      the Submission pages to find out how YOU can contribute to the project. I want this song to
      contain the sum total of human wisdom (seriously!) and we have. . .a bit of a way to go.</p>

      chorus as friends, old band mates, and relatives (including Freedy Johnston, Kramer, and
      Butler's mom) mess with the music. Weird, long-winded, wonderful."</p>

              </center>

              <p>Morgan Fisher (ex-Mott The Hoople keyboardist) requested a one-minute version of
              "The Devil Glitch" for inclusion in his second <em>"Miniatures"</em> CD. The 60 or so
              compositions on this disc come from around the world and all deal in some way with a
              Millenium theme.<br />
              <br />
              Morgan never said WHICH Millenium, however. "The Devil Glitch" includes an audio
              time-travel ending, which is a regression back to 1900 via the entire history of
              audio recording technology (digital-tape-wire-wax cylinder).</p>

      <p><b>Guidelines for Submissions:</b></p>

      <ul type="square">
        <li>Submitted audio should be an MP3 or .wav file.<br />
        <br />
        Preferred: wav file, 44.1 khz, at least 16 bit, 24 bit even better<br />
        OK: mp3, encoded at best resolution possible, at least 192kbps, 320kbps even better</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>Keep it down to 2-3 minutes, please.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>The click and acoustic track is there for your convenience, but you are not bound to
        use this. And please no fade-ins or fade-outs if possible...editing this thing is going to
        be enough of a pain. A "1-2-3-4" count-in would be helpful, too.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>Please remember that a "song" is legally defined in America as having "a melody and
        lyrics", so please include some variation on the "Sometimes you can fix something by..."
        lyric line. Thus, instrumental-only submissions will probably not be used. I may add some
        lyrics to your chunk, but it will be a low, low priority.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>- Re: censorship. I reserve the right to edit anything that is submitted. That said, I
        am not a prude, so rough language is not a turn-off...but neither do I wanna get busted for
        distributing internet obscenity, so use your head about what you say, okay?</li>

        <li style="list-style: none"><br />
        <br /></li>

        <li>Legal stuff: You own your contribution, period - but by submitting it, you are allowing
        me to use it in this project in perpetuity. If you want to register it with the Library of
        Congress or any other performance right organization in your country, that is your
        business. There is a chance that some other media (TV, radio, etc.) might do a news piece
        on this project and use some of what you've submitted. If this happens, I will do my best
        to get you a cue sheet so if there is any dough generated, you get it. To that end, you
        must include some info about yourself, personal web page URL &amp;/or contact info with
        your submission or it can't be used. You also grant me the right to use this info in the
        project, but I will not give or sell your info to any third party, so don't get all
        nutzparanoid about this. Also, you warrant that your submission does not violate the rights
        of any third party.</li>
      </ul><br />
