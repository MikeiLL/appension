<p>In 1995, I wrote and recorded a song called <b>The Devil Glitch</b>, which clocked in at 5:03.  One day, I'm trading off playing demos with muso pal Nick Berry from Dots Will Echo, and he plays one and I play one and he plays one and then I play him "The Devil Glitch", apologizing sheepishly 'cause the vamp at the end is 12 choruses long and I don't remember if he said it or if I said it or if the caffeine said it but suddenly we're both giggling 'cause the problem with the song isn't that it's too long it's that it's too <b><i>short</i></b>!  and wow!...wouldn't it be cool to fill up a whole CD with choruses??<br/><br/>

So that's what I did.  Three months later I'd written over 550 of them (usually in the early, early morning before the cares of the day shut off the joy valve).  I then recorded the whole thing at one sitting with an acoustic guitar (the chords are A Bm D6) to an 114 BPM click track in 20-minute chunks at Harold Dessau Studios in Lower Manhattan, with Scott Anthony engineering (and soon to be drafted as the project's long-time, long-suffering Sys Op). The next step was to pass out 2-3 minute chunks on Alesis ADAT cassettes to people I've worked with and asked them to add their own background accompaniment on synths, spoons, tuned vacuum cleaners...whatever.  This was in April of '95, thinking I'd have everything back by May and the whole thing assembled by Memorial Day.<p>

<p>Wrong.  It took a year to get everything organized, but that's okay 'cause the software to actually glue the thing together wasn't available in '95, and Freedy Johnston took forever to hand in his piece (worth it) and Liam Sternberg (Mr. "Walk Like An Egyptian") from Akron and now France had to do his too and Kramer (who had been the Waitresses original sound man!) had to be goosed to get his bit in (also worth it) and don't get me started about my Mom (never try to produce your Mom). <br/><br/>

Scott stitched the whole thing together using SAW+ (we had become a Beta project for the software!), having to regrettably edit the long version down to allow for the original 5:03 song, since at the time CDs could only hold 74 minutes of audio.</p><br/>
<p>Then, thanks to the internet - there was NO time limit, so I began the process of expanding the song, making an online version that hopefully would go on for hours and hours. And it did: <b>The Major Glitch</b>.
<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center"><b>The Major Glitch</b> is a sonic "sculpture"<br/> - a single, seamless recording that includes all the submissions to date, plus the original Intro and Ending sections from the original CD recording.</div> </p>

	<li>can sing</li>
	<li>speak english</li>

  </ol>

<p>Under the philosophy that anything is entertaining and insightful provided it’s sincere (or at least obviously fun), we’ve got a few options by which you can contribute.
</p>

  <p><b>Guidelines for Submissions:</b></p>

<ul id="submit-points">

  <li>It can be as long or as short as you want.</li>
<br/>
  <li>The part that I'd like for you to expand upon is the ending vamp where every lyric line begins <i>"Sometimes you can fix something by..."</i>.<br/>Please remember that a "song" is legally defined in America as having "a melody and lyrics", so please include some variation on the <i>"Sometimes you can fix something by..."</i> lyric line. Thus, instrumental-only submissions will probably not be used. I may add some lyrics to your chunk, but it will be a low, low priority. </li>
<br/>
  <li>If you're able to fit your lyric text into the couplet format: "Sometimes you can bla bla bla... Another line of bla bla... blank line... Sometimes, etc", then the Glitch Oracle will be happy.</li>
<br/>
  <li>Re: censorship. I reserve the right to edit anything that is submitted. That said, I am not a prude, so rough language is not a turn-off...but neither do I wanna get busted for distributing internet obscenity, so use your head about what you say, okay?</li>
<br/>
  <li>Legal stuff: You own your contribution, period - but by submitting it, you are allowing me to use it in this project in perpetuity. If you want to register it with the Library of Congress or any other performance right organization in your country, that is your business. There is a chance that some other media (TV, radio, etc.) might do a news piece on this project and use some of what you've submitted. If this happens, I will do my best to get you a cue sheet so if there is any dough generated, you get it. To that end, you must include some info about yourself, personal web page URL &/or contact info with your submission or it can't be used. You also grant me the right to use this info in the project, but I will not give or sell your info to any third party, so don't get all nutzparanoid about this. Also, you warrant that your submission does not violate the rights of any third party. </li>
</ul></p><br/>
<h2>For those who want to create their own track at home or in a studio</h2>
<ul id="submit-points">
  <li>Submitted audio should be an MP3 or .wav file.<br/><br/>
  Preferred: wav file, 44.1 khz, at least 16 bit, 24 bit even better<br/>
  OK: mp3, encoded at best resolution possible, at least 192kbps, 320kbps even better</li>
  <br/>
    <li>The click and acoustic track is there for your convenience, but you are not bound to use this. And please no fade-ins or fade-outs if possible...editing this thing is going to be enough of a pain. A "1-2-3-4" count-in would be helpful, too.</li>
<br/>
  <li>You can download the 114 Beats-Per-Minute click track/acoustic guitar file <a href=" http://infiniteglitch.net/instrumental_track">HERE</a></li>
<br/>
  <li>You can submit a track <a href="/submit">HERE</a>.</li>
  </ul>

<br/>
<hr style="max-width:90%"><br/>
<p>

<span id="highlight">We want everybody to be able to contribute.</span> So even if you don't have the instruments and recording equipment available, here are a couple of tools to allow you to make a track and then submit it:</p>
<a href="/recorder"><img src="static/img/recording-studio-link.png" border="0" width="116" height="85" alt=""></a><br/>
	Definitely a BETA endeavor! Using the microphone in your computer, you'll be able to record yourself singing along with the single glitch instrumental track and upload it, then hear it back with the instrumental, input lyrics and story and submit the track. "Glitch Johns, the engineer" will walk you through the process of recording and submitting a track.<br/>
You will need to <a href="/create_account">Sign Up</a> before you can access this part of the Infinite Glitch.<br/><br/>
<a href="https://www.ujam.com/" target="_blank"><img src="static/img/ujam-logo.png" border="0" width="74" height="36" alt=""></a><br/>
Another BETA project we came across, which it seems like has been in limbo for a while, but still works and is really really cool: UJAM offers online software that allows you to record and produce your own song. "All you need to create great-sounding music is an idea. Turn that melody in your head into a song." After you make you track on UJAM you just export it as an MP3 and submit it using our <a href="/submit">form</a>.<br/><br/>

<b>The Story Behind the One-Minute Version of "The Devil Glitch"</b><br/>
</center>
<p>Morgan Fisher (ex-Mott The Hoople keyboardist) requested a one-minute version of "The Devil Glitch" for inclusion in his second <em>"Miniatures"</em> CD. The 60 or so compositions on this disc come from around the world and all deal in some way with a Millenium theme. <br/><br/>Morgan
never said WHICH Millenium, however. "The Devil Glitch" includes an
audio time-travel ending, which is a regression back to 1900 via the
entire history of audio recording technology (digital-tape-wire-wax
cylinder).

<hr style="max-width:450px"><br/>
<p>For a laugh, I sent a copy of the CD to the Guinness Book people, thinking I might have inadvertently set a record. Their response was "Maybe. Yep. Prove it." Guinness required for independent verification, and although I knew it to be a valid claim, getting others to confirm it became a "computer era" question, where information becomes available only if the question is phrased correctly.
<br/><br/>
For example, neither the Library of Congress (where American copyrights are registered), BMI and ASCAP (the USA's major performance rights organizations) nor The Harry Fox Agency (collector of mechanical rights) can search their databases for length...only by title and author. Luckily, David Sanjek of the BMI Archives was able to confirm my claim stating that "I know of no other commercial piece of music that received sufficient public distribution that comes close to "The Devil Glitch" in length and scope." William Shurck, the Sound Recordings Archivist at Bowling Green State University's Music Library and Sound Archive, also saw no reason to dispute my claim, based on his "...40-plus years of working with popular music."). Homer's "Illiad" and "Odyssey" were actually "sung". . .but no one is around who remembers how it goes. "Alice's Restaurant"? A mere 19-minutes, and it's as much talking as it is a "song", which is legally defined in America as a "lyric with a melody". I'm sure my record has long been broken, and as far as i know, Guinness has retired the category, but the original project was fun to do, and it's nice to be recognized...even for such a dubious achievement.</p>
